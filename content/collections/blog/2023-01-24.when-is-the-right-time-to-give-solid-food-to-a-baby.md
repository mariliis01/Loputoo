            text: 'When is the right time to give solid food to a baby? If a baby is breast fed, you can start giving them additional food from the seventh month onwards. For the first six months, the best food for a baby is breast milk. It’s also the most convenient and the cheapest food and your child will get everything they need, including enough water. Only vitamin D could be necessary to add during this time.'

            text: 'During the seventh month of life, the baby becomes significantly more active and breast milk no longer covers the daily energy need. If you see that your child is already very interested in food and watches you eat during meals, then it’s the right time to warm up the first puree for the child and let them start tasting it.'

            text: "If it is not possible to breast feed the child, supplementary food can start to be given from the age of four months. This is usually due to, for example, certain medicines prescribed to the mother or insufficient milk production. In the latter case, you should definitely consult a breastfeeding adviser, as the problem may be solvable.\_"

Make a puree of local organic vegetables by steaming or boiling them with a little liquid. If you do not have the necessary ingredients or time, BabyCool frozen or freeze-dried purees are a very convenient and nutritional food for your child. Note that canned foods have lost a significant part of their value due to it being heated multiple times. '
