Unlike storing fruits and vegetables in the cellar, where they lose their vitality, freezing maintains their nutritional value impeccably. Imagine that frozen sustenance remains delectable for up to two years, allowing you to savour local harvests all year.'

Blend various frozen concoctions or enhance other meals with them. Watch as your child''s daily veggie and protein needs effortlessly met. Think pumpkin-lamb puree over rice or quinoa, delivering both a toothsome texture and a nutritious punch. Slide a carrot cube into pasta or homemade sauce for a delightful surprise. Pear or apple puree cubes make breakfast porridge divine - they cool while adding a touch of fruity delight.'
