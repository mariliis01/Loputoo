            text: "Why frozen puree cubes? Freezing is one of\_the best ways to preserve food. By keeping vegetables and fruits in a cellar, they lose significantly more of their nutritional value than in a freezer. Frozen food stays good for up to two years and allows you to consume local garden produce all year round."
