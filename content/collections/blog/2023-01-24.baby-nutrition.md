That’s when the baby becomes significantly more active and breast milk no longer covers their daily energy needs. If it’s not possible to give breast milk to the baby, only start giving supplements with the recommendation of a general practitioner.'

Make the porridge more liquid as well, in the beginning you can use wholemeal flour or flakes. You can also grind the flakes smaller or grind the porridge with a hand mixer. Add a little unrefined vegetable oil or butter to both the puree and porridge because the child also needs vegetable and animal fats and this increases the nutritional value of the food. From 9 months on, cow’s milk (a little amount) can also be added to porridge. Both butter, oil, and meat are added to the puree just before giving it to the child.\_"

It is important to make sure that the meat is high quality and fresh. Always give organic meat to your child – it doesn’t contain residues of antibiotics or plant protection products. The meat should be that of a young animal – this is especially important in the case of the liver, as all toxins are deposited there. The liver is the cleanest in a young, free-range animal. However, the liver contains a lot of iron, as well as vitamin B, vitamin D, and plenty of vitamin A. Due to the high vitamin A content, it’s not recommended to eat it every day, only about a spoonful a week.'

By keeping vegetables and fruits in a cellar, they lose significantly more of their nutritional value than in a freezer. Frozen or freeze-dryed food stays good for up to two years and allows you to consume local garden produce all year round. If purees are frozen in cubes or as freeze-dryed powder, you can choose a portion that is exactly the right size for the child to eat in one sitting. In addition, the various purees can be mixed together or added to other meals so that your child can meet their daily meat or vegetable needs. For example, you can add pumpkin and lamb puree to rice or buckwheat – this way you can feed solid food to a child who already has some teeth.'

Your child should be offered one food up to 20 times – if they still don’t eat it, then this particular food probably doesn’t taste good to them. A child older than a year can already eat all the basic foods at a dinner table with the family, or at least as much as they have an appetite for. '
